## Watch Store.

- Write a console application Watch Store. Set a hierarchy of goods (a certain general class for a group of goods, and classes that describe specific types of watches, such as quartz, mechanics, solar, and so on - think over the hierarchy yourself). The watch has at least a name, price, date of receipt in the store, think over the rest of the characteristics yourself.
- The application can display a list of all products in the console
- The application can sort and display products in the console by: name, price, date of receipt.
- The application can show the total cost of all products
- The application allows you to add new products to the store from the console
- Use MVC architecture

- In the model, when the application starts, use a ready-made data set (explicitly specified in the code) (filling the collection).
